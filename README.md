# Lab 9: Quantile Mapping Implementation

**Date:** October 31, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 11

## Overview

This lab introduces students to implementing quantile mapping algorithms for climate data bias correction. Students will learn both empirical and parametric approaches to quantile mapping, validate their implementations, and understand the challenges of preserving correlations between climate variables.

## Topics Covered

- Empirical and parametric quantile mapping implementation
- Bias correction validation and statistical assessment  
- Correlation preservation challenges in multivariate correction
- Hydrological model forcing with bias-corrected climate data
- Comparison of different bias correction approaches

## Objectives

- Implement empirical and parametric quantile mapping
- Apply bias correction to temperature and precipitation
- Validate bias correction methods statistically
- Understand correlation preservation challenges
- Force hydrological models with bias-corrected climate data

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the quantile mapping tools that students will need for PS2 Task 4 (implementing bias correction and assessing improvements in streamflow projections), providing practical experience with the most common climate downscaling approach.
